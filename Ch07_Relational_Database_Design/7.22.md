> Give a lossless, dependency-preserving decomposition into 3NF of schema $R$ of Exercise 7.1.

--------------------------------

Use the algorithm given in Figure 7.12.

Also don't forget that $F = F_c$ (see exercise 7.7)

$$
R_1 = \{ A, B, C\}  \\
R_2 = \{ C, D, E\} \\
R_3 = \{ B, D\} \\
R_4 = \{ E, A\} \\
$$
